TODO List

In Order of Priority:

(*) Measure how long people have been in VC, send messages into #action-log. (Ask them for a summary of what they did via DM perhaps?) Aggregate results into MongoDB database for monthly reports

(*) Add ability for bot to post reminder in #coming-up when events start

(*) Auto-kick function - if people have not joined a voice channel for 4 weeks, kick them automatically.

(*) Add the ability for users to self-assign roles for their respective timezones (reaction/clicking a button)

(*) Add welcome message DMs, with link to single video file.

(*) Add ability to reserve voice channel by reacting to a message/clicking a button on a message in #lets-talk-about. Max 4 people? Allow users to mention WHO can join voice channel??

(*) Add ability to subscribe to additional text channels in same way ^

(*) Add ability for users to self-timeout themselves from accessing the Discord server, by letting the bot ban them for X amount of time (same with access to text channels)

(*) Add Pomodoro timer

(*) Add feedback form functionality

(*) Auto-unlock workshop-chat when a workshop event is hosted
